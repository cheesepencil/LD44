# CRNC - Catching Really Nice Cats
A game for Ludum Dare #44, "Your life is currency" (tortured into "Your life is C.R.N.C)

## Premise
You are Gramma Gertrude and your life is collecting nice kitties! Catch all the stray cats in town and add them to your collection at home.

### Controls
* Left and right arrows for movement
* Up and down arrows for climbing ladders and taking cross streets
* Up arrow to enter buildings
* Shift to pick up or throw a stray cat
* Spacebar to jump

### Win Condition
Catch all 100 stray cats in the neighborhood before your home is condemned by the city council!

### Mechanics
* Stray cats wander around town. Catch them and return them to your home to win!
* If Gertrude is out of the house after nightfall, she enters sundowner mode and loses the ability to run, jump, or carry cats!
* Naughty children, stray dogs, and vermin will slap cats out of Gertrude's hands, or knock Gertrude down, wasting time.
* Police and Adult Protective Services will take Gertrude's collected cats away!
* Get caught by police or APS three times and the city council will condemn your home, ending the game.
